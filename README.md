# chi2_test

Contingency Table Creation: Start by creating a contingency table (also known as a cross-tabulation or crosstab) that represents the observed frequencies of the two categorical variables you want to analyze.

Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis: The null hypothesis (H0) states that there is no significant association between the two variables. The alternative hypothesis (Ha) states that there is a significant association between the variables.

Expected Frequencies: Calculate the expected frequencies for each cell in the contingency table under the assumption that the variables are independent. This is done by multiplying the row total and column total of each cell and dividing by the overall total.

Chi-Squared Statistic: Calculate the chi-squared statistic using the formula:

χ² = Σ ( (O_ij - E_ij)² / E_ij )

where O_ij is the observed frequency in cell (i, j) and E_ij is the expected frequency in cell (i, j).

Degrees of Freedom: Determine the degrees of freedom for the chi-squared test. This is calculated as (r - 1) * (c - 1), where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns in the contingency table.

Critical Value or P-Value: Compare the calculated chi-squared statistic to the critical value from the chi-squared distribution table at a certain significance level (alpha) or calculate the p-value associated with the chi-squared statistic.

Decision: If the calculated chi-squared statistic is greater than the critical value or if the p-value is less than the chosen significance level, you reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is a significant association between the variables. Otherwise, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Conclusion: Based on the decision, you draw a conclusion about whether there is a significant relationship between the categorical variables.
